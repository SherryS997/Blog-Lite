                        Classical logic is a 19th and 20th-century 
innovation. The name does not refer to classical antiquity, which used 
the term logic of Aristotle. Classical logic was the reconciliation of 
Aristotle's logic, which dominated most of the last 2000 years, with the
 propositional Stoic logic. The two were sometimes seen as 
irreconcilable.
                        <br>
                        
                        Leibniz's calculus ratiocinator can be seen as 
foreshadowing classical logic. Bernard Bolzano has the understanding of 
existential import found in classical logic and not in Aristotle. Though
 he never questioned Aristotle, George Boole's algebraic reformulation 
of logic, so-called Boolean logic, was a predecessor of modern 
mathematical logic and classical logic. William Stanley Jevons and John 
Venn, who also had the modern understanding of existential import, 
expanded Boole's system.
                        <br>
                        
                        The original first-order, classical logic is 
found in Gottlob Frege's Begriffsschrift. It has a wider application 
than Aristotle's logic and is capable of expressing Aristotle's logic as
 a special case. It explains the quantifiers in terms of mathematical 
functions. It was also the first logic capable of dealing with the 
problem of multiple generality, for which Aristotle's system was 
impotent. Frege, who is considered the founder of analytic philosophy, 
invented it to show all of mathematics was derivable from logic, and 
make arithmetic rigorous as David Hilbert had done for geometry, the 
doctrine is known as logicism in the foundations of mathematics. The 
notation Frege used never much caught on. Hugh MacColl published a 
variant of propositional logic two years prior.
                        <br>
                        
                        The writings of Augustus De Morgan and Charles 
Sanders Peirce also pioneered classical logic with the logic of 
relations. Peirce influenced Giuseppe Peano and Ernst Schröder.
                        <br>
                        
                        Classical logic reached fruition in Bertrand 
Russell and A. N. Whitehead's Principia Mathematica, and Ludwig 
Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico Philosophicus. Russell and Whitehead 
were influenced by Peano (it uses his notation) and Frege and sought to 
show mathematics was derived from logic. Wittgenstein was influenced by 
Frege and Russell and initially considered the Tractatus to have solved 
all problems of philosophy.
                        <br>
                        
                        Willard Van Orman Quine insisted on classical, 
first-order logic as the true logic, saying higher-order logic was "set 
theory in disguise".
                        <br>
                        
                        Jan Łukasiewicz pioneered non-classical logic.
