                        Aristotle analyzed qualities in his logical 
work, the Categories. To him, qualities are hylomorphically–formal 
attributes, such as "white" or "grammatical". Categories of state, such 
as "shod" and "armed" are also non–essential qualities (katà 
symbebekós). Aristotle observed: "one and the selfsame substance, while 
retaining its identity, is yet capable of admitting contrary qualities. 
The same individual person is at one time white, at another black, at 
one time warm, at another cold, at one time good, at another bad. This 
capacity is found nowhere else... it is the peculiar mark of substance 
that it should be capable of admitting contrary qualities; for it is by 
itself changing that it does so". Aristotle described four types of 
qualitative opposites: correlatives, contraries, privatives and 
positives.

                        John Locke presented a distinction between 
primary and secondary qualities in An Essay Concerning Human 
Understanding. For Locke, a quality is an idea of a sensation or a 
perception. Locke further asserts that qualities can be divided in two 
kinds: primary and secondary qualities. Primary qualities are intrinsic 
to an object—a thing or a person—whereas secondary qualities are 
dependent on the interpretation of the subjective mode and the context 
of appearance. For example, a shadow is a secondary quality. It requires
 a certain lighting to be applied to an object. For another example, 
consider the mass of an object. Weight is a secondary quality since, as a
 measurement of gravitational force, it varies depending on the distance
 to, and mass of, very massive objects like the Earth, as described by 
Newton's law. It could be thought that mass is intrinsic to an object, 
and thus a primary quality. In the context of relativity, the idea of 
mass quantifying an amount of matter requires caution. The relativistic 
mass varies for variously traveling observers; then there is the idea of
 rest mass or invariant mass (the magnitude of the energy-momentum 
4-vector), basically a system's relativistic mass in its own rest frame 
of reference. (Note, however, that Aristotle drew a distinction between 
qualification and quantification; a thing's quality can vary in degree).
 Only an isolated system's invariant mass in relativity is the same as 
observed in variously traveling observers' rest frames, and conserved in
 reactions; moreover, a system's heat, including the energy of its 
massless particles such as photons, contributes to the system's 
invariant mass (indeed, otherwise even an isolated system's invariant 
mass would not be conserved in reactions); even a cloud of photons 
traveling in different directions has, as a whole, a rest frame and a 
rest energy equivalent to invariant mass. Thus, to treat rest mass (and 
by that stroke, rest energy) as an intrinsic quality distinctive of 
physical matter raises the question of what is to count as physical 
matter. Little of the invariant mass of a hadron (for example a proton 
or a neutron) consists in the invariant masses of its component quarks 
(in a proton, around 1%) apart from their gluon particle fields; most of
 it consists in the quantum chromodynamics binding energy of the 
(massless) gluons.
