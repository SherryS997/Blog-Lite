                        Speculative reason, sometimes called theoretical
 reason or pure reason, is theoretical (or logical, deductive) thought, 
as opposed to practical (active, willing) thought. The distinction 
between the two goes at least as far back as the ancient Greek 
philosophers, such as Plato and Aristotle, who distinguished between 
theory (theoria, or a wide, bird's eye view of a topic, or clear vision 
of its structure) and practice (praxis), as well as techne.
                        <br>
                        
                        Speculative reason is contemplative, detached, 
and certain, whereas practical reason is engaged, involved, active, and 
dependent upon the specifics of the situation. Speculative reason 
provides the universal, necessary principles of logic, such as the 
principle of non-contradiction, which must apply everywhere, regardless 
of the specifics of the situation.
                        <br>
                        
                        On the other hand, practical reason is the use 
of reason to decide how to act. It contrasts with theoretical reason or 
speculative reason. Some may try and refer to practical reasoning as 
moral reason but this kind of reasoning actually falls in line more so 
with theoretical reasoning as it's a contrast of practical reason. This 
has little to do with what's practical as practicality involves specific
 action, decision, and particulars which all have a logical undertone 
without bias toward an ideology. Moral reason finds itself being more 
malleable in its spectrum of reasoning and had the possibility of being 
skewed by faith and belief. This will lead to discrepancies in 
practicality given the nature of morals being a culture specific 
outlook, and will reduce the practicality in an outcome as each 
individual has a separate point of view and can change the outcome of 
moral reasoning. Yet there are philosophers who have erected systems 
based on this distinction. Two philosophers who have done so are Thomas 
Aquinas (who follows Aristotle in many respects) and Immanuel Kant.
