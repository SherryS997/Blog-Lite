                        Cubism is an early-20th-century avant-garde art 
movement that revolutionized European painting and sculpture, and 
inspired related movements in music, literature and architecture. In 
Cubist artwork, objects are analyzed, broken up and reassembled in an 
abstracted form—instead of depicting objects from a single viewpoint, 
the artist depicts the subject from a multitude of viewpoints to 
represent the subject in a greater context. Cubism has been considered 
the most influential art movement of the 20th century. The term is 
broadly used in association with a wide variety of art produced in Paris
 (Montmartre and Montparnasse) or near Paris (Puteaux) during the 1910s 
and throughout the 1920s.

                        The movement was pioneered by Pablo Picasso and 
Georges Braque, and joined by Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Robert 
Delaunay, Henri Le Fauconnier, Juan Gris, and Fernand Léger. One primary
 influence that led to Cubism was the representation of 
three-dimensional form in the late works of Paul Cézanne. A 
retrospective of Cézanne's paintings was held at the Salon d'Automne of 
1904, current works were displayed at the 1905 and 1906 Salon d'Automne,
 followed by two commemorative retrospectives after his death in 1907.

                        In France, offshoots of Cubism developed, 
including Orphism, abstract art and later Purism. The impact of Cubism 
was far-reaching and wide-ranging. In France and other countries 
Futurism, Suprematism, Dada, Constructivism, Vorticism, De Stijl and Art
 Deco developed in response to Cubism. Early Futurist paintings hold in 
common with Cubism the fusing of the past and the present, the 
representation of different views of the subject pictured at the same 
time or successively, also called multiple perspective, simultaneity or 
multiplicity, while Constructivism was influenced by Picasso's technique
 of constructing sculpture from separate elements. Other common threads 
between these disparate movements include the faceting or simplification
 of geometric forms, and the association of mechanization and modern 
life.
