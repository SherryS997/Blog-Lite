                        Philosophy of science is a branch of philosophy 
concerned with the foundations, methods, and implications of science. 
The central questions of this study concern what qualifies as science, 
the reliability of scientific theories, and the ultimate purpose of 
science. This discipline overlaps with metaphysics, ontology, and 
epistemology, for example, when it explores the relationship between 
science and truth. Philosophy of science focuses on metaphysical, 
epistemic and semantic aspects of science. Ethical issues such as 
bioethics and scientific misconduct are often considered ethics or 
science studies rather than the philosophy of science.
                        <br>
                        
                        There is no consensus among philosophers about 
many of the central problems concerned with the philosophy of science, 
including whether science can reveal the truth about unobservable things
 and whether scientific reasoning can be justified at all. In addition 
to these general questions about science as a whole, philosophers of 
science consider problems that apply to particular sciences (such as 
biology or physics). Some philosophers of science also use contemporary 
results in science to reach conclusions about philosophy itself.
                        <br>
                        
                        While philosophical thought pertaining to 
science dates back at least to the time of Aristotle, general philosophy
 of science emerged as a distinct discipline only in the 20th century in
 the wake of the logical positivist movement, which aimed to formulate 
criteria for ensuring all philosophical statements' meaningfulness and 
objectively assessing them. Charles Sanders Peirce and Karl Popper moved
 on from positivism to establish a modern set of standards for 
scientific methodology. Thomas Kuhn's 1962 book The Structure of 
Scientific Revolutions was also formative, challenging the view of 
scientific progress as the steady, cumulative acquisition of knowledge 
based on a fixed method of systematic experimentation and instead of 
arguing that any progress is relative to a "paradigm", the set of 
questions, concepts, and practices that define a scientific discipline 
in a particular historical period.
                        <br>
                        
                        Subsequently, the coherentist approach to 
science, in which a theory is validated if it makes sense of 
observations as part of a coherent whole, became prominent due to W. V. 
Quine and others. Some thinkers such as Stephen Jay Gould seek to ground
 science in axiomatic assumptions, such as the uniformity of nature. A 
vocal minority of philosophers, and Paul Feyerabend in particular, argue
 that there is no such thing as the "scientific method", so all 
approaches to science should be allowed, including explicitly 
supernatural ones. Another approach to thinking about science involves 
studying how knowledge is created from a sociological perspective, an 
approach represented by scholars like David Bloor and Barry Barnes. 
Finally, a tradition in continental philosophy approaches science from 
the perspective of a rigorous analysis of human experience.
                        <br>
                        
                        Philosophies of the particular sciences range 
from questions about the nature of time raised by Einstein's general 
relativity, to the implications of economics for public policy. A 
central theme is whether the terms of one scientific theory can be 
intra- or intertheoretically reduced to the terms of another. That is, 
can chemistry be reduced to physics, or can sociology be reduced to 
individual psychology? The general questions of philosophy of science 
also arise with greater specificity in some particular sciences. For 
instance, the question of the validity of scientific reasoning is seen 
in a different guise in the foundations of statistics. The question of 
what counts as science and what should be excluded arises as a 
life-or-death matter in the philosophy of medicine. Additionally, the 
philosophies of biology, psychology, and the social sciences explore 
whether the scientific studies of human nature can achieve objectivity 
or are inevitably shaped by values and by social relations.
